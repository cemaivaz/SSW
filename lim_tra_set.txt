886841	4174886124	@SheShoots I completely disagree. Counselors focus on your emotions/reactions. Life coaches are much more practical and goal-oriented.	2009-09-22 11:00:49

886841	4176197786	@SheShoots And it's on you to vet your life coach. Set your criteria and assess them accordingly. Get references.	2009-09-22 11:58:20

19912849	4034651388	I think Paulo Coelho's book "The Alchemist" should be required reading.  It is a modern classic and phenomenal.	2009-09-16 13:11:29

18864575	4104657676	Orhian Johnson set to make his Buckeye debut, I believe, on the kickoff coverage unit as we get under way. (via @JeffSvoboda)	2009-09-19 11:09:00
18864575	4104693983	Rolle with the first tackle of the game.  Like it should be.	2009-09-19 11:09:00
18864575	4104699990	Torrence with his first start.	2009-09-19 11:09:00
18864575	4104775296	That was a beautiful throw and catch.  Good for Dane, rocking it out against his home town school.	2009-09-19 11:09:00
18864575	4104781811	@Victory330 Thanks for the heads-up.	2009-09-19 11:09:00
18864575	4104794088	First starts today: Duron Carter, Shugarts, Torrence and Buchanan.	2009-09-19 11:09:00
18864575	4104879055	Great pressure shown by the D line, tho not unexpected.	2009-09-19 11:09:00
18864575	4104896541	@WorstFan, Simon is KILLING IT.  Push up the middle is something we haven't seen in years.	2009-09-19 11:09:00
18864575	4104917706	If the Buckeyes go up top again, it's safe to say that EVIL Jim Tressel is in the house.  And that's a good thing.	2009-09-19 11:09:00

18864575	4105051499	Boren's first bad play of the year.	2009-09-19 11:09:00
18864575	4105072539	So far my assumption is correct: the Toledo defense is not quite as good as the USC unit.	2009-09-19 11:09:00
18864575	4105090576	@rollerOSU broadcast crew seems to be doing well so far.  some insights, no real screw-ups.	2009-09-19 11:09:00

kevin devine & owen in centennial commons at northeastern university *tonight* @ 6 : 00 pm .  free public show !  see me there fools . 
i am exhausted ,  completely unprepared ,  lacking motivation ,  and anxious 24/7 .  i just want to live in my bed or leave without telling anyone . 
"for the agony ,  i'd rather know ,  cause blinded i am blindsided .  would you really rush out for me now ? "
bon iver & pb frozen yogurt are the only things keeping me alive at work on this miserable day . 
work and homework are owning my life this weekend .  serious hermit status . 
@devinekd wish i was around to boycott the internet & television with you tonight  -  i could go for some stella ,  scrabble ,  & other stella  ; ]
@nickpit i'd also like to know the answer to that question ,  honestly .  what should be going on is foodler ,  jeepers creepers ,  and the cave . 
@yoitsseanp yes please ,  i want to see your new place too ! 
constant lack of sleep ,  relief ,  release ..  kill me ,  text me ,  join me ,  whatever . 
@liana _ iglesias i will join you in a mission to make that dream a reality .  i think we'd make a pretty solid team . 
so much homework and yet all i ever do is post on my blog ,  which i'm pretty sure only i read .  counterproductive ?  time to regroup . 
@joeycoxxx dammit joey if i was aware of that we could have had savage t - swift singalongs in my car !  you owe me . 
flawless :  
i did not do my homework or go to the gym .  i did go to the lit mag meeting and spend hours at temptations .  i do not know what's going on . 
i love andrew bercik and joe merturi both equally and passionately . 
stayed up until 6am watching ridiculous music videos with @josephmerturi & am now sleepwalking through class/work .  do i regret it ?  fuck no . 
in the library and way too tired to do my work ,  but also way too tired to ride my bike home .  why can't i teleport or apparate yet ?  stuck .

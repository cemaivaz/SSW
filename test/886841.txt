@sheshoots i completely disagree .  counselors focus on your emotions/reactions .  life coaches are much more practical and goal - oriented . 
@sheshoots and what makes you think there aren't any life coaches that haven't achieved success ?  and what's the definition of success ? 
@sheshoots i don't think any life coach aims to provide counseling services .  it's not "fake therapy . " it's not therapy . 
@sheshoots and it's on you to vet your life coach .  set your criteria and assess them accordingly .  get references . 
@sheshoots danger in unlicensed legal advice is legal ,  in unlicensed counseling is psychological ,  in unlicensed life coaching is what ?

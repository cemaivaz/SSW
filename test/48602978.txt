friday night is soapmaking night for me .  i made a batch of grapefruit lily and also a batch of sandalwood vanilla . 
the sv seized on me in the pot so i had to glop it into the mold like congealed applesauce .  but it'll be fine .  it's cooking in the oven now . 
had to retrieve this one from the deleted folder and share it because it's just too funny !   
conviction is humbling . 
i'm planning to run away soon .   (only in my mind of course)
@jrbettis  -  magic eraser ! 
meanwhile ,  back to reality .   holiday schmoliday !   this is a free work day at home . 
listening to 2nd fav practical teacher while i work .   he's teaching on christian philosophy  --- > 
trading in books at the used paperback bookstore on my lunch hour .  i like suspense but decided to weed out anything with abuse in the plot . 
there has always been stories in the news of people abusing children but i read one the other day that was so horrible ... 
 .... that i won't repeat it .   and that was the final straw .   no more for me ! 
if the oldest living twitterer can figure out how to link to facebook so one updates the other ... then i should be able to figure it out too . 
so i'm trying to figure it out now .   testing ,  1  -  2  -  3 !!! 
hubby & i are looking for one tv show we can watch together .  our tastes are very diff & i just don't watch much at all .   found burn notice ! 
darn it .   burn notice has a great premise and fun characters ,  but i just can't get past their usage of gd and jesus as swear words . 
"if you listen to constructive criticism ,  you will be at home among the wise . "  pro . 
rt @majoratwh :  an absurdly long report/meditation on carter ,  race ,  obama ,  the gop and civil rights politics .   
purchased the new tobymac song ,  "city on our knees" .   awesome song !   i knew within hearing the first 10 seconds that i would buy it . 
the little one now has her very own ipod thanks to her music - loving mommy and is lying in bed listening to disney princess songs right now . 
hubby just taught daughter to squint one eye and say "arrghhh !!!! " in honor of it being the national "talk like a pirate" day .

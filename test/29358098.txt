so stressed ... like you wouldn't even believe . 
taking a break from physics to watch entourage
finally done with physics ... too awake to sleep ,  so i guess it's on to ex phys
@maxbemis "is a real boy" got me through my first 10k ... i haven't stopped listening ever since . 
i'm going to make it a point to make this the best year ever .  off to take my first physics exam ...

we tend to get what we expect . 
@2bnb _ rva does the bus come to each stop at around the same time each hour ?  how do i know the next time the bus will be around ? 
back from a lovely lunch at can can and promenade around carytown .  locked in my apt preparing for the ex phys exam .  wish me luck .   : (
@chels _ marx i saw them too .  you tryna join ? 
@crossfitrva depends on how you define a great facility .  whatever you do ,  don't choose "b" . 
that one hour of sleep and all night of studying paid off .  i predict a b . 
i'm in a glass case of emotion right now .  wow ... god is good . 
running on my third day without sleep .  gotta love exams .  last one for this round tomorrow . 
god do i hate adam sandler movies . 
somewhat caught up on sleep .  but not quite ...

"unannounced portal" makes me giggle imaging my coworkers' grant proposals if they really did discover a portal to mars in the nevada desert
@jyvegas i usually pack a baggy of earplugs .  i pass them out to my seatmates if a baby starts crying ,  thus winning me instant popularity . 
productive day !   headed to class .   annoyed that @nealmason is skipping our classes tonight ,  but i guess i skipped one on tuesday ... 
finally have time to go to the grocery store ,  for the first time in 2 weeks ...  getting really sick of take - out and fast food ! 
@dustbury even if it means eating 2 - for - $1 jack - in - the - box tacos for 1 or 2 meals per day ? 
refrigerator full of real food = happiness . 
watching the guild by myself because @nealmason would rather play warcraft .   oh ,  the irony ... 
argh !   i so helpfully set my alarm clock for pm instead of am and woke up 3 hours late . 
and now our oven has a gas leak .   it's one of those days .   is it lunchtime yet ?   i need ice cream . 
@nealmason you're really looking forward to my company picnic ?   because that's what we're doing next sunday . 
friday lunch is the highlight of my week ! 
yes !!!!   turning off my voicemail has led to the desired behavior modification in others  --  my mother just send me a text message .   awesome . 
i guess old people can learn to use modern technology ,  when forced to .   : )  my mother has given me hope for the boomer generation .   : )
suv blocking traffic .  guy said he'd been stuck an hour & no one would help him push it .  so i recruited 4 guys in &lt ; 2 min .  feminine wiles ftw ! 
@nealmason you already are a complete asshole three days a month .   why do you think i get so irritated with you then ?    : )
showing dave how twitter and socialscope work . 
pondering what i want to be when i grow up ...  a wealthy cfo or a happy academic ? 
@nealmason nealiepoo ! 
@dwax i know lots of happy academics .  just none in humanities or non - business social sciences .   : )
@nealmason nealiepoo !

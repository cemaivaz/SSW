listened to a lot of new music today .   david gray (consistent) ,  vertical horizon (meh) ,  monsters of folk (meh) ,  dirty projectors (yum) . 
new music tuesdays and lala . com go so well together ,  that free first listen to a whole album feels like a gift that repeats once a week . 
listening to some great bruce youtube songs thanks to @sportsguy33 .   the energy and passion are an inspiration .  happy 60th to the boss . 
saw a demo this morning of a new internal bz tool that has put a hop in my step today .   ideas are coming to life .

favorite moment of jack's 4 mo checkup yest ?   the doc using the phrase "generous in size" to describe his appearance .   19 . 3 lbs ,  29 . 5 in .

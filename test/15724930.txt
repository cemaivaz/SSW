i'm getting less than 3mb/s right now .  what gives ? 
thanks for nothing itunes update !  smart playlists are still synced out of order on my iphone .  grrrr ! 
@tchachra sorry to hear that but it does make me feel a little better knowing i'm not the only one still having issues . 
on the phone with time warner tech support .  3mb/s is unacceptable !  we're top tier dammit ! 
i have lost packets . 
sadly ,  since @mryoshi is away on a business trip ,  talking to twc tech support is the geekiest conversation i've had all day . 
twc says they are at critical mass in my area right now ,  but since my bandwidth is less than 80% of what it should be ,  tech is coming out . 
too many little technical issues to deal w/ right now .  going offline for a bit to make a veggie pizza & veg on the couch w/ cruz .  #fb
my blog post on privacy issues on the facebook iphone app is still getting comments saying the problem hasn't been fixed yet . 
anyone else still having problems w/ wall posts made by friends using the fb iphone app not following your privacy settings or have a fix ? 
@twittelator when i refresh in twittelator pro ,  it keeps jumping to the bottom & doesn't start from last read tweet or say how many unread . 
@twittelator i figured that's what it was .  thx ! 
internet download speed is back up to 27mb/s this morning .  go baby go ! 
@waynedixon ugh !  and i was on the phone with twc yesterday complaining i was only getting 3mb/s .  i guess i'm spoiled .

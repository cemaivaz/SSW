tiredddddd ...  don't wanna go outttttttt ... 
it's not just my imagination ,  right ?  the words on twitter page are changing font .  or weight .  aren't they ? @frachely @melissa _ chan @imbeatrice
@frachely pretty sure they did !  esp at 'home' and 'what are you doing ? '
@frachely and the boldness on your nickname and the numbers of followers ,  following ,  tweets ...  stuff like that
lying under the blanket researching these email hoaxes that i keep getting fwded .  so far done burundanga namecards and emirates rape claims . 
i dreamt about a new club where every hour they pour out free shots of whisky standing on the bar and spraying mixer all around @kfcho
@frachely hehe no !  i forgot all about it .  maybe one day ...?  i heard it's really exp . 
pretty cool !  rt @time see the top 10 doctored photographs | 
@frachely gotta save all that money for the freaking expensive dutch exam ! 
@frachely gotta take the exam in order to stay and work here ...  it's about dutch society and a bit of dutch language too . 
i don't understand what it is with the coloured birdies as people's icons .  someone enlighten me ! 
@kfcho7 but ppl who previously had pictures suddenly display the birdies ? 
i keep thinking :  why don't my friends tweet more so i can read more ?  then i realise i just keep refreshing my page but i never tweet myself . 
weetabix for brekkie .  finishing up my tea .  my ibook just successfully crashed @omigod's router by connecting to it .  good way to sabotage ppl
neck and shoulders aching .  can't wait for neck massage later !

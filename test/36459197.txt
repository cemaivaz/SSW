@pberry well i'll be damned . 
@tay _ diggs12 you're right about that .  nice work ! 
@pberry what do you think of tonight's game with the spread ?  dallas is favored  - 3 . 
@tay _ diggs12 what do you think of tonight's game ?  dallas is favored  - 3 vs .  ny giants . 
@giantskickoff no offense ,  but you're not exactly an unbiased source ... 
@pberry if the giants win ,  i win the $30 prize for the week in my money league .  if they lose ,  so do i . 
rt @sportsguy33 :  my friend sully just emailed me asking if jerry jones secretly bought nbc .  didn't know the answer .  but wouldnt be shocked . 
tony romo makes some hilariously awful decisions . 
@thebopper interesting .  what are some current "funny" comedies ? 
i know miami was pretty good last year ,  but is anybody picking them to beat indy tonight ?  seems like there's big money in that  - 3 spread . 
scratch that  -  my girlfriend picked the fins .  i just talked her out of it and she switched to the colts .  now i really have to root for indy . 
@brucejernick how can you hate any team with that awesome color scheme ?  congrats on your jets beating down pretty boy brady yesterday !

@tay _ diggs12 whatever it is ,  i'll take the under . 
@zanelamprey you won't be so happy when you get the bill . 
@chardoesntknow heh .  funny . 
@bgirl77 maybe he wasn't and your vision is just awful . 
for the first week of fall ,  it sure is hot .  maybe there's something to that global warming thing the "experts" keep warning us about .   : )

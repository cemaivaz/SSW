@sugarjones so ,  did the kids braid her hair today ,  at the meeting ,  or what ?!?   ; )
@sugarjones and if so ,  i want to see evidence ... in the form of a twitpic !  mhmmm . 
@sugarjones lol ... cute .  rubberbands were so fun when we were kids .  wishing i could come hear you speak at sitscation ,  i'm sure you'll rock !! 
@virtueimc good for you !  you know ,  the more fruit you eat ,  the more you will crave it ,  and it will satisfy your cravings for sweetness .   : )
@virtueimc but an occasional dessert won't kill you ...  i just am not a big dessert eater .  usually too full from actual dinner ,  and water ! 
@virtueimc we slice watermelon and wash berries and grapes ,  and keep them readily available for after dinner yummies .  my kids love fruit ! 
@virtueimc well ,  next time you go to the store ,  buy some of those yummy flavored yogurts .  i've never tried them ,  but hear they are yummy !   : )
@virtueimc ugh ... that sucks .   what about power/clif bars ?  yummy flavors available ! 
@virtueimc something quick and easy for when you are in a hurry ,  as well ,  and can't stop and prepare food/drink to satisfy ! 
@virtueimc i will research for you and find you something that will satisfy ...: )
@virtueimc lol ... okay ,  i will let it slide this time ...  or next time i will just offer you some cheese with your whine ...   ; )

wrasslin' with some code for the new blog .  forgot how satisfying coding (even if it's only html) can be . 
boy howdy i sure hope this rain stops before i have to leave for my film screening . 
@cliffhanger407 yah .  and there's a huge cell coming in from the sw ,  gonna hit us in 30 - 45min
ffffffuuuuuuu all options concerning the film screening are undesirable . 
soaked after that ill - advised bike back in the rain .  in my defence was barely raining when i left .  on the plus side ,  i stripped in the hall . 
if this wind keeps up it's gonna be a very low - scoring game ,  methinks .  #redsox #angels
@wigu well i have a few ideas ... 
what does it mean when i'm dozing off in between pitches ?  we're talking moments of unconsciousness lasting 20 - 30 seconds here . 
the hell just happened with pedey and ells right there ?  i thought he scored !  #redsox
you know ...  if we had to drop one ,  i'd have to say tonight's as good as any .  #redsox
this game is killing me #redsox
ffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu #redsox
thank you #angels infielders for another godsend .  #redsox
i couldn't have picked a worse night to be at home watching this game by myself .  #redsox
that ...  just fucking happened .  i cannot believe my accursed eyes .  #redsox
still somewhat in disbelief ,  as i inexplicably watch col v .  sf #redsox
@surviving _ grady game of the season ?  yes .  yes .  very yes . 
two heart - wrenching games tonight ,  my heart cannot handle this !  damn you ,  #braves and #redsox ! 
what a successful night at karaoke ,  and regarding baseball .  gotta finish up this blog post ,  and then bedtime #redsox
post done ...

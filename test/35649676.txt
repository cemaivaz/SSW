@alison __  i just want to go back to high school in general . 
@13th _ doctor i'm still tired . 
@alison __  um ,  no . 
@alison __  i guess i'm doing the impossible then . 
@alison __  i guess it falls under friends .  the people here suck ,  and i just had a way more enjoyable experience in hs .  academics too . 
@o3visuals college is shaping up to that for me .  i loved high school . 
@alison __  i would !  there is no pro to college for me .  besides higher education ,  of course . 
@alison __  that's no good . 
@tom _ bleaker apparently i'm one of the few ,  the proud ,  the high school nostalgic . 
poll :  how many people miss high school ?  or prefer it to college ? 
@chris _ palting you're a creeper . 
@o3visuals that is impressive .  or proof of our faulty education system .

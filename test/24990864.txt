i really love awards season ,  but i have no interest in watching the emmy's tonight .  probably because i've never seen mad men or 30 rock . 
@wesleyhunter yeah haha .  willa ford made me laugh !  lol .  i thought it was an ok movie as far as horror movies go . 
i think aragorn is so hot !  i would do him all night long ! 
@chrisgeidner creepy ! 
@juris that is correct .  i have seen a bit of an episode where megan mullaly was an adoption agency lady . 
my only hope is that mary louise parker and castmates weed out the competition !
